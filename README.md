# Computer Networks - Austin Saylor, Fall 2024

This repository contains the work I did for a course on computer networking. In this course, I worked on projects related to sockets, virtual machines, routers, switches, and building a virtual network with these tools. My final project for this course was a network scanner which utilizes IP addresses and uses ARP, ICMP, and port scanning.
