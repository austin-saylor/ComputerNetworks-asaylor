# Computer Networks - Austin Saylor, Fall 2024

This repository contains the work I did for a course on computer networking. In this course, I worked on projects related to sockets, virtual machines, routers, switches, and building a virtual network with these tools in GNS3. My final project for this course was a network scanner which utilizes IP addresses and uses ARP, ICMP, and port scanning.

| Project    | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| [Basic-Socket]   | A basic socket which finds the IP addresses for a given hostname.             |
| [Client-and-Server]    | Demonstrates client and server connection through a socket.  |
| [Lab1-Connection]    | A demonstration of connecting two virtual machines in GNS3. |
| [Lab2-Routers]    | A lab exercise which tests network connectivity through static routing. |
| [Lab3-NetworkRouting]    | A lab exercise which focused on building a network using VMs, routers, and switches, then testing its connectivity. |
| [Final-Project]    | A network scanner utilizing IP addresses, ARP scanning, ICMP scanning, and port scanning. |
